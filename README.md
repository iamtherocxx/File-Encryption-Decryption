# File-Encryption-Decryption
Java project to Encrypt or Decrypt text files using a basic caesar cipher implementation.

Running the program gives the user the option to either Encrypt or Decrypt a file.
The input and output file paths are taken as input, along with the shift for the cipher.

Full file paths should be used for in/output files; e.g: C:\Users\thisUser\thisFolder\thisFile.txt
